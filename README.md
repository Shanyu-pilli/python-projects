## Projects Overview

Here's a brief overview of each project included in this repository:

### ATM Simulation

A console-based application simulating basic ATM functionalities like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

### Choose Your Own Adventure

An interactive text-based game where the user makes choices that determine the story's outcome.

### Currency Converter

A program that converts currency values between different denominations.

### Dice Rolling Game

A simple game that simulates rolling a dice, generating random numbers.

### Num Guesser

A classic "guess the number" game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

### Password Generator

A utility to generate strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, character types).

### Password Strength Checker

A tool to assess the strength of a given password, providing feedback on its security.

### Pig Dice Game

A popular dice game where players try to score points by rolling a die, with a risk of losing all points if a 1 is rolled.

### QR Code Generator

A program that generates QR codes from text or URLs.

### Quiz Game

An interactive quiz application that tests the user's knowledge on various topics.

### Rock Paper Scissors

A command-line implementation of the classic hand game.

### Simple Text Editor

A basic text editor that allows users to create, open, edit, and save text files.

### Slot Machine Game

A simulated slot machine game, demonstrating random outcomes and simple game logic.

### Tic Tac Toe Game

A two-player command-line version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

### To-Do List Application

A simple application for managing tasks, allowing users to add, mark as complete, and delete items from a to-do list.

## How to Run a Project

To run any of these projects:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME/PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME
    ```
    (Replace `PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME` with the specific project you want to run, e.g., `ATM Simulation`).

3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python your_project_main_file.py
    ```
    (The main file might be `main.py`, `app.py`, or similar. Check the specific project folder for the correct file name.)

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x

## Future Enhancements

I plan to continue improving and expanding this collection of projects. Potential future enhancements include:

* Adding more complex features to existing projects.
* Developing new projects covering different areas of Python programming.
* Implementing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for some of the console-based applications.
* Adding unit tests for improved code reliability.
